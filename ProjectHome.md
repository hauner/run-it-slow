For long running builds (like building [Qt](http://www.qtsoftware.com)) it is annoying when the fan goes up to 6000 rpm after a couple of seconds and keeps there for hours.


I like to have a small tool that limits the cpu usage of a process and its child processes to less than 100% to keep the fan running at silent 2000 rpm to 3000 rpm. Of course building will take a lot longer but at least it doesn't make any noise.


I didn't find any tool that did work for me on MacOSX (Snow Leopard).


Although it is a tool with a purpose it is a learning project for Objective-C (based on foundation framework), test driven development (with OCUnit (part of XCode), [OCMock](http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/OCMock/)) and cucumber.
