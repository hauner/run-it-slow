slow, a cpu limiting process runner
===================================

For a long running build (like building Qt) it is annoying when the fan goes up
to 6000 rpm after a couple of seconds and keeps there for an hour.

I like to have a small tool that limits the cpu usage of a process and its child
processes to less than 100% to keep the fan running with low 2000 to 3000 rpm.

I didn't find any tool that did work for me on MacOSX (Snow Leopard).

Allthough it is a tool with a purpose it is a learning project for Objective-C
(based on foundation framework), test driven development (with OCUnit, OCMock)
and cucumber.


Usage
=====

slow is called like this:

slow "command"
slow -l 10 "command"

The -l option tells slow the allowed cpu usage percentage, ie. -l 10 will allow
"command" to use up to 10 percent of the available cpu power.

"command" has to be put in quotes (for now) so it gets evaluated as a single
argument.

If slow receives a signal (like ctrl+c or ctrl+z) it will propagate the signal
to "command".
